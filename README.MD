# QISS: Quantum Industrial Shift Scheduling Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of a quantum algorithm for industrial shift scheduling (QISS), which uses Grover's adaptive search to tackle a common and important class of valuable, real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Our work shows how complex real-world industrial optimization problems can be formulated in the context of Groverâ€™s algorithm, and paves the way towards important tasks such as physical-level resource estimation for this category of use cases.

## Paper

Details about the algorithm, as well as background and motivation can be found in the paper, which will be uploaded to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/quant-ph?searchtype=author&query=Krol,+A). This link is intended to be a placeholder (but should allow finding the paper when it is uploaded).

If you use this code, please cite the paper.
